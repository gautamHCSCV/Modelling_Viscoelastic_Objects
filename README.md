# Modelling_Viscoelastic_Objects
Data-Driven Haptic Modeling of Normal Interactions on Viscoelastic Deformable Objects  Using a Random Forest model and a RBF model. Our approach is to build a Deep Learning model to beat the other the existing models in terms of root mean square error.

# Feature Based Learning
Root Mean squared Error = 0.185
