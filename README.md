# Modelling_Viscoelastic_Objects
Data-Driven Haptic Modeling of Normal Interactions on Viscoelastic Deformable Objects  Using a Random Forest model and a RBF model. Our approach is to build a Deep Learning model to beat the other the existing models in terms of root mean square error.

### Proposed an efficient technique to model the force at different positions for homogeneous objects in virtual environment.
### CatBoost model outperforms the existing modelling methods available with Random Forest and RBF models.
